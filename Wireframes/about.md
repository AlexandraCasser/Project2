Wire Framing Process

My wireframes involved quite a bit from what you see here, though the app is still limited to three pages.  Originally I hoped to somehow include images and a navbar at the top of the page, but that was sacrificed in favor of buttons and a simple title.  I decided to avoid having two index pages, and put my drop down of users on the same page as log in.
