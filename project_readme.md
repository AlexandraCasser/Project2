***Project 2 Yearbook***

**Approach** 


This app is intended to be a simple CRUD app that allows users to create profiles with walls similar to Facebook.  Users can leave short posts on each other's profiles.  The profile owner can delete posts on their own wall.  All users can view all posts without being logged in; a user must be logged in to leave a message and manage their own wall.  Users have the ability to edit their username, which is displayed on their profile.

**Unsolved Problems**

The app requires more tweaking to be intuitive to new users and streamlined to use, including alphabetizing existing users on the users drop down menu and using more accurate placeholder text in text fields.  I would also like to eventually automatically append the user's name onto their posts instead of having to have them fill it in manually.
